<p>The real tragedy is that the code you write above is the wrong approach. In a highly concurrent system, these operations are best executed in the database, that's why you have complex update queries. Otherwise, this would just create a concurrency lock due to an overabundance of transactions.</p><p>So, even if you have ACID properties, the sort of code above is the wrong approach. It doesn't take advantage of Atomicity. You should avoid this pattern of loading a value, incrementing it application-side and storing it back. You should simply affect the value directly with a db operation (be it a NoSQL $inc or a SQL UPDATE).</p><p>So, if you were doing this correctly with MongoDB, you'd simply write:<br>    db.Account.update({_id: ..., balance: {$gte: amount}}, {$inc: { balance: amount }});</p><p>This guarantees you can only update the account if it still has enough balance, and does so directly in the database as an atomic operation. Then you can take care of updating the other document on the receiving end.</p><p>Granted, this will not take care of other ACID properties, but at least it's atomic and will only cause issues if the server crashes. If you were doing this rather than the application-side in-memory approach, it wouldn't be an issue.</p><p>So, the problem is not with MongoDB. It's with programmers not understanding the tools they're using, and the culture of rockstar programming which encourages rapid-application-development with poorly written ODMs/ORMs and the ensuing technical debt.</p>

<p>MongoDB's update operation will only get you so far.  Assuming it's correct (a whole other discussion entirely), the atomic update will only affect one document.  It's still possible for one operation or the other to fail, leading to lost updates and irreconcilable account balances.</p><p>HyperDex also provides atomic update operations (<a href="http://hyperdex.org/doc/latest/CAPI/#api:c:atomic_add)" rel="nofollow">http://hyperdex.org/doc/latest...</a> which we omitted from this article for clarity.  You could update the account with "db.cond_atomic_sub('accounts', 'src', {'balance': GreaterEqual(amount)}, {'balance': amount})" and "db.atomic_add('accounts', 'dst', {'balance': amount})".</p><p>Now take those two operations, roll them up in a HyperDex Warp transaction, and you're guaranteed to always transfer the money from one account to the other without any possibility for inconsistency.  The transaction guarantees both updates happen, or the pair fail without effect.</p><p>The problem is not with programmers' understanding.  There's a pervasive and wrong movement that encourages people to use eventually consistent systems.  They will justify it with statements of the form, "If it's good enough for banks, then it's good enough for you."  This thinking is dangerous.</p><p>At the end of the day, your application is the sum of its invariants.  If the data store underneath your system is incapable of providing you with guarantees---or worse, requires extensive care, and a $100K support contract to provide you with guarantees---your application is broken and blaming the developers for this is a cop-out.  We should be holding database vendors (especially those with hundreds of million in shiny VC cash) to a higher standard.</p>

<p>You are very much right, of course.</p><p>However, just using atomicity would have prevented these bitcoin issues, because the worst that could happen is that the destination account would not be credited the amount, if the server crashed after deducting the amount at the source.</p><p>I'm not saying it'd solve the remaining issues (we got ACID for that) - my point is solely that if you're using MongoDB and you're not even using atomicity, then the flaw is not with the database. It's with the programmer.</p><p>And I'd go further to say that if you're using MongoDB for something it wasn't designed for, the fault is not with MongoDB, it's with the programmer.</p><p>At the end of the day, you must take responsability for the tools you use.</p>

<p>This is not a database problem - banks need to distribute transactions, only primitive banking systems rely upon a single database with an atomic operation. Any developer writing banking software that is not aware of concurrency and transactional issues is at best incompetent, and more likely dangerous.</p><p>While your basic point is valid, an ACID system does not solve the problem, it merely pushes it to an application boundary, where the problem re-occurs.</p><p>And in reality, most banking systems are actually already eventually consistent, and rely upon compensating actions, along with a significant number of failsafes to pull operations that are suspicious.</p><p>Banking was a bad example domain to use, and shows the issue of developers thinking that as they have ACID in their database they are protected from issues of concurrency</p>

<p>Indeed. I think this article points out a flaw with BitCoin more than with first gen NoSQL. In a normal bank, transactions are recorded. If you overdraw your account, you are liable. The ATM does not necessarily prevent you from doing so and saying "the atm gave me the money" will not be sufficient to erase the overdraft fees.</p><p>With BitCoin, how would they come after you for the difference? :-D</p>

<p>MongoDB doesn't claim to be ACID. If the developer didn't think this through then it's them at fault and not the technology. I use MongoDB for everything except where transactions are needed and then I use the RIGHT tool for the job (which is not MongoDB).</p><p>Blaming the DB for something that's the fault of the developer is ridiculous!</p>

<p>Great article highlighting the risks in new financial intermediaries.  Banks do not (and can not) operate the way you describe, however.  In the Cap theorem, banks usually opt for eventual consistency because they need partition tolerance (else: unrecoverable corrupted accounting) and accessibility (else: bank not available = run on the bank).  This leads banks to be vulnerable to the attack you describe.  One example (similar to the attack you write about) is check kiting.  Banks guard against these attacks (and others) using specific fraud prevention controls (likely using out of band checks on number of transactions, transaction amounts, and other pattern recognition methods - making different CAP tradeoff selections for those systems).  I think this example is just one area where the IP related to fraud built up within financial institutions over centuries has not been fully encapsulated by those in the crypto-currency world.</p>

<p>What you actually need to avoid here is lost update, which has to be handled in almost any DB the same way - either using serializable isolation level or using locking. Which can be either pesimistic - lock - update - unlock or optimistic - begin - update - validate - commit/rollback &amp; reset/merge/retry. Same as with let's say SVN with locking vs. SVN without locking. First one is oldschool approach used in Client/Server statefulll session applications, which is safe, but inhibits the concurrency and brings overhead with locks management. What we do in web/distributed, highly concurrent stateless apps is the second approach - we are optimistic, that only we are updating data and deal with conflict when it arise. Upon update you check that you update the same data, that you've read - you read some record version number/system change number/compute checksum of read data and than use it to check, that it did't change when you update it. When it is not the same, you deal with it - either inform user, that other user has changed the data, or you reread data and restart/retry.</p>

<p>Cassandra has consistency levels. For example consistency_all makes sure that changes propagate to each server. That does not solve every problem mentioned here but it is an option to get full consistency (allowing lock - read - write - unlock). However, imho using ANY nosql db for banking is generally a bad idea and the maturity of 'next generation nosql data stores' might be even lower.</p>

<p>Your code example goes wrong with negative balances. Your DB should protect you from that though. Not your programming logic.<br>With most mentioned problems, ACID and MVCC are the key. But that alone doesn't protect from race conditions. This biggest problem are programmers that have no clue what they're doing. <br>Github has a ton of open source 'exchange software' that just don't make sense. Not using transactions, no prepared statements and even using floats just to name a few. I don't even want to start about their lack of understanding on how a matching engine should work.</p><p>Trading calculations should take place at the DB level. In functions/stored procedures. It just doesn't belong in the code. Using these also increases security (and performance) and keep programmers away where they don't belong.<br>And as for what the 'right' environment for an exchange is... it depends on the programmers choice. In a financial world, I would say that an exchange build around Oracle, DB2 or SQL Server environment is the way to go. I'm sure you can get a good working trading platform build in PHP/Node/MySQL/NoSQL or whatever but the programmer sure as hell should know what he's doing. He's just asking for trouble.<br>It's like running a marathon on wooden shoes. It's possible but unlikely.</p>

<p>Just a tip for interested devs seeking a panacea to the NoSQL inanity that is plaguing us all; HyperDex may or may not be it for you.

<p>Good point! The code illustrates solely the concurrency-related issues. It does not authenticate the user or ensure that their auth cookie did not expire, does not clean inputs, does not check that the account number indeed belongs to the user, does not authorize the sender or the recipient against a blacklist of suspended accounts, does not check for a negative withdrawal, and does not log the operation. And I'm sure there are plenty of other things I'm leaving out that someone with a better background in web programming can chime in with.</p><p>A decent web framework would help with some of these, but as you point out, a good developer needs to get every single one of these checks right. It's pretty difficult to do all of this correctly when the database underneath can give you stale answers without warning and provides no mechanisms to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>You can do this in MongoDB as well. But you are forgetting the balance check (ie check that there are equal or more money in the account). You can't do that it you can not rely on that there is no pending updates to the account somewhere else not yet replicated.</p><p>I.e. you could withdraw 100 from account with a balance of 100 twice if done close together. Even if you ended up with -100 on the account (which would be correct) you would still be able to overdraw the acccount (which you shoudn't be allowed to do).</p><p>(Would add that I am not that familiar with Riak so not sure if and how to you can get around this there).</p>

<p>From what I understand Warp is quite costly (requires a support contract), and has a performance trade off with global transactions (without them transactions aren't durable to disk and there are edge cases where committed transactions can be lost). The support contract cost alone puts it beyond the reach of moderately-skilled-developers-with-little-to-no-funding.</p><p>Surely the solution for most developers that need proper ACID transactions for cryptocurrency-based sites (or other financial apps) should be something like a Galera cluster, as you can start that off as (essentially) a standalone MariaDB instance and scale it up from there? Sure, it may not be as performant and "web scale" as HyperDex, but by the time you're at the level that requires something as performant as HyperDex you will be able to afford it or you'll be able to afford enough hardware to make a Galera cluster as performant.</p><p>NB: I know that you're part of the HyperDex project, and I'm not trying to bash it on any level, just talking around the solutions that will make the most sense considering the generally average-ish skill level among web developers in the cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>Hi, Amisalabs offers a .Net driver (ADO.Net Interface) for the first true relational, nosql hybrid DBMS.

<p>Cons:<br>Needless contention on the queue.</p><p>Complexity of a correct queue implementation.

Especially if it's fault-tolerant!</p><p>Pros:<br>I find it difficult to even think about the pros. A synchronous queue on top of a modern scalable database is like a training wheel on a Bugatti.</p>

<p>The bank/ATM example makes perfect sense simply because Flexcoin was a bank. Reality is telling us something here, and it's goes against the dogma that you often hear repeated.</p><p>The oft-repeated statement that "banks are not ACID" misses the point. Of course banks are "not ACID": any system that allows you to back-date a transaction is not linearizable.</p><p>A bank timeline is delta-consistent and monotonic. That is, the interface posed by the bank to the outside world typically never goes backwards, and there is a time period delta after which the timeline quiesces.</p><p>The thing is, you cannot build delta-consistency or monotonicity on top of a data store that is just eventually-consistent. And in fact, banks don't. They use ACID databases to record their internal processes. That's why when you make a transaction and call later to see if the same system still has the data you recorded, they can give you a definitive answer. People would revolt if their deposits appeared in their account, then disappeared, then reappeared. A bank, which is an amalgamation of many systems, might appear "eventually consistent" to a casual observer (though it is typically delta-consistent and monotonic), but it's internal architecture relies on ACID systems.</p><p>The "banks are not ACID" meme got pushed hard by people trying to defend eventual consistency. Find me a bank that maintains its accounting on a first-gen NoSQL database and I'll show you a broken bank.</p>

<p>Just because you use an eventually consistent database, doesn't mean your deposits can appear and disappear.</p><p>Banks do not implement your bank balance using the method you described. Which you just admitted. So please stop using it as an example. A bank is going to store "deduct $100 from account XYZ". Some time in the future it may go through collecting the transactions and updating your balance. But you don't need ACID for that. You just need locks.</p>

<p>&gt;A bank is going to store "deduct $100 from account XYZ". Some time in <br>the future it may go through collecting the transactions and updating <br>your balance. But you don't need ACID for that. You just need locks.</p><p>It doesn't matter whether the bank stores a bank balance or a list of deposit and withdrawal operations. If a bank stored operations in an EC store, as you propose, the EC store could lose some operations, e.g. during a server failure. It doesn't matter whether locks are held or not.</p><p>The confusion here is stemming from the SLA at the bank level, which is eventually consistent (actually, it's delta-consistent, but for this discussion, we can be imprecise to favor the EC argument), versus how the bank operates internally, which is typically ACID. Yes, it's absolutely true that the banking system overall is "eventually consistent." But this doesn't mean that individual components of this system can behave in an EC manner with impunity. I'm not aware of any regulated banks that employ anything other than ACID databases for maintaining customer accounts and branch operations. Are you? Even customer support hotline calls are typically kept in ACID databases even though they play absolutely no role in a bank's externally visible SLA, because it is critical from a business perspective that they behave monotonically ("non-erratically" is what a customer would call it if she called and her previous calls were not recorded).</p>
